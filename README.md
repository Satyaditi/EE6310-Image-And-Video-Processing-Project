# EE6310: Image and Video Processing - Final Project

In the 1950s, the space program provided high-resolution images of Earth, the Moon, and Mars, but technical issues degraded them. Digital image restoration emerged to extract more information by applying signal processing techniques. The first application was in images of the comet Halley. Image processing is now routine in astronomical observations. Recent advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning have given researchers more tools to explore and understand our nearby celestial neighbors. Therefore, image processing is undoubtedly one of the most important pre-processing and analytical phases in this pipeline.

The goal of this project is to construct high-resolution astronomical images from severally blurred and noisy low-resolution images and then remove satellite trails. We can then enhance the image to improve image contrast quality. We then finally compare the output images with the original images using different metrics.
